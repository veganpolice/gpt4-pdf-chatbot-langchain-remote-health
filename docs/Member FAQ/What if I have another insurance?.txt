What if I have another insurance? You can enroll in Remote Health as a top-up plan. The advantages of also using Remote Health with another insurance include: Faster treatment: reduced wait times to get the treatment you need by not joining public waiting lists.Freedom to choose the hospital you want: using a public health service can often restrict the hospitals you can visit. Remote Health gives you access to any public or private hospital.Eligible for cash payout: get paid up to $150 when staying in a free public hospital or when your treatment is covered by different insurance.Global coverage: use this coverage wherever you live, move, or work, so if you are a nomad or traveling, you don't need another insurance to cover your medical care.A referral from your general practitioner is not required before seeking care with a specialist. \cf3 \
