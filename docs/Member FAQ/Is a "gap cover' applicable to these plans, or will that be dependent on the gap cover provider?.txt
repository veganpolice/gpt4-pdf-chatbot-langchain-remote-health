Is a "gap cover' applicable to these plans, or will that be dependent on the gap cover provider? This would be dependent on the gap cover provider. On the Remote Health plan, any expensive treatments or visits can be pre-approved and have direct billing arranged. If the charges are outside of what is considered "reasonable' for the area (UCR), you can choose another provider and we will get pre-approval and direct billing set up with them. Or you can choose to pay the difference in cost, though this is relatively rare.
