What happens if I have to undergo surgery? Would those be covered within the $5,000 outpatient limit or is it in a separate budget? Most surgeries are covered under the Core Plan as you are typically admitted to the hospital. Our plan includes up to 100% UCR for inpatient surgery and $500,000 for outpatient surgery, sometimes called day surgery. This would not come out of your $5,000 outpatient benefits.If you need surgery, you must provide advanced notice by filling out {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https: \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 this form}}. Please provide at least two weeks' notice if you're requesting direct billing.
