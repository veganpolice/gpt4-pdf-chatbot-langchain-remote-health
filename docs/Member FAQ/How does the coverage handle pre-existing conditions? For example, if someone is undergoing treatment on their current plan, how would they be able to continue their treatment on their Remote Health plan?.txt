How does the coverage handle pre-existing conditions? For example, if someone is undergoing treatment on their current plan, how would they be able to continue their treatment on their Remote Health plan? Generally, pre-existing conditions are covered as long as they are not excluded in the overall policy. The application for the plan will ask if any new members have a major medical condition already in treatment, such as cancer or heart issues. If the answer is yes, please let our team know of the condition or treatment. It could result in the application being denied or a waiting period. For new members added mid-policy term, the admin won't be asked if the member has pre-existing conditions, but if the admin has information about the major undergoing treatment, they should let us know.
