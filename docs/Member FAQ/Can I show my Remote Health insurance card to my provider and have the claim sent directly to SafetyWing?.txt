Can I show my Remote Health insurance card to my provider and have the claim sent directly to SafetyWing? When you see your provider for treatment, you must pay upfront and file your claim for reimbursement in your member profile. If your claim is greater than $250, direct billing can be arranged, but we need to have advance notice to complete this process.
