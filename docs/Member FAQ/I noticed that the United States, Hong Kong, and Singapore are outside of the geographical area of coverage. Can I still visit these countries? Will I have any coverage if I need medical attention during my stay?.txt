I noticed that the United States, Hong Kong, and Singapore are outside of the geographical area of coverage. Can I still visit these countries? Will I have any coverage if I need medical attention during my stay? You can visit the United States, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and be covered for accidents and emergency non-elective treatment. \\You're covered up to 100% UCR for injuries up to a maximum of USD $50,000 and up to a maximum of USD $500 for outpatient services. This coverage is limited to 30 days per trip, up to 183 days per year.
