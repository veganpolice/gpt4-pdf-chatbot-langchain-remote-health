In Colombia we don't usually get receipts for what we paid for consultations. Do I have to have a receipt to receive my claim reimbursement? Also, is it ok if my doctor provides me with a handwritten receipt? A receipt of some sort is required for reimbursement. It can be handwritten, as long as they provide the receipt on doctor, clinic, or hospital letterhead, and there is a signature.
