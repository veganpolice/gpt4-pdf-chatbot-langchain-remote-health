Are there any waiting periods? Remote Health coverage begins the same day as your start date! There are no waiting periods if your plan is provided and paid for by your employer. If you  are paying  for your own plan as an individual, there is a 10-month waiting period for maternity benefits and a 36-month period for HIV treatment.
