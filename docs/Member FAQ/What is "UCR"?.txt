What is "UCR"? UCR stands for "Usual, Customary, and Reasonable Cost." Based on published industry standards, the UCR is determined based on the expected cost of a procedure in that country.For example, if the UCR is $100 for an arm splint and the hospital charges $120, the insurance company will pay up to $100 for that procedure.For major procedures, we strongly recommend setting up direct billing with the hospital or doctor so that the member can learn if the cost of that hospital is above the UCR for that procedure. We have a 24 email and phone line for emergencies. Direct billing can be set up within two weeks for non-emergencies and immediately for emergencies.
