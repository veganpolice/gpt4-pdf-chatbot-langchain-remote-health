For the vision benefit, what if your glasses cost over $500? Can members use the outpatient amount to cover the excess? What about Lasik? The vision benefit includes one set of frames every 24 months and one set of lenses or contact lenses every 12 months. You can submit vision claims for up to $500 USD, and any extra cost would be a personal expense.\You cannot use outpatient benefits to cover claims related to vision. Lasik  is not a covered benefit because it is an elective procedure.
