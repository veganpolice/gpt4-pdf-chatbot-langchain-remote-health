If I go over the maximum benefit, will I need to cover the rest? Remote Health will cover up to the maximum limit of the benefit, and the member pays for any coverage costs above this limit. For example, if you claim $600 for vision services, you would receive a reimbursement for $500 if the claim is approved.
