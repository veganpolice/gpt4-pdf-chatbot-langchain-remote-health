For all treatments and visits under $250 USD, you will pay your provider directly after the treatment or visit. Before you leave the office, please collect medical notes detailing what the treatment was for and the date you received treatment.You will also need to request an invoice or receipt for the amount paid. Then you will log onto your SafetyWing online dashboard, click "make a claim," and fill out the form.\It will only take you a few minutes. The form will ask you for details of why you needed the treatment, what the treatment was, your medical notes and receipts, and your banking information for reimbursement. Reimbursements should take 21 days or less.For any treatment over $250 USD or pre-planned costly procedures, you can contact us and request pre-approval and direct billing. To do so, submit a treatment plan, medical notes, and estimated costs using {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https: \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 this form}}.
