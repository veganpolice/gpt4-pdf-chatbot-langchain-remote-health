What is the company application time frame? How long before a company is signed up? Once everything is filled out, turned in, and verified, the approval process takes up to a week. During that time, we will introduce you to your account manager, who will create the custom dashboards and set up meetings with your team to show how the system works, confirm that all members are added, and be ready to start using your policy on the go-live date. Altogether the process takes 2-3 weeks but can be done in as little as a week depending on everyone's calendars.
