Is Remote Health insurance locally compliant? Remote Health is different from a local or state-run insurance, as it is a global insurance plan. We provide members with worldwide coverage where members can go to any clinic or hospital.In contrast, local plans may be subject to networks and restrictions. You may need to buy separate private insurance for extra benefits, and these plans tend to be inflexible and bureaucratic.With Remote Health, you can go to any clinic or hospital without worrying about eligibility requirements. Your treatment options remain consistent wherever in the world you travel and in 185+ countries of residence. It can be used as a top-up coverage (e.g., dental, vision) in countries with local insurance requirements and tax considerations. We cannot provide advice on tax implications or visa requirements for every country we operate in.Remote Health would be treated as a benefit like any other from a company taxation standpoint.Notable exceptions: In the following countries, local regulations may restrict members from using Remote Health as their primary health insurance. Fortunately, it can still be used as a top-up plan for extra benefits like dental, vision, and maternity care.GermanySwitzerlandNetherlandsAustralia
