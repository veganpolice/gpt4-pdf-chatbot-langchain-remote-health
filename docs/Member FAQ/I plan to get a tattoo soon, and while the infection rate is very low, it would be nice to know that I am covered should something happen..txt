I plan to get a tattoo soon, and while the infection rate is very low, it would be nice to know that I am covered should something happen. Remote Health does not have an exclusion for pigments or body ink. Therefore, should a member get a tattoo and has the misfortune of getting an infection, we would cover the treatment of the infection and symptoms under the outpatient benefit.
