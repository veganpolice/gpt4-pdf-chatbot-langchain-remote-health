How would coverage work for specialists and surgical procedures? Specialist: It isn't necessary to have a referral from your general practitioner to seek treatment with a specialist. Unless you are admitted to the hospital, specialist fees will be covered under the outpatient benefit (max $5000 per policy year).Surgical procedures: some treatments like surgery require you to provide advance notice. Fill out {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https: \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 this form}} to notify us of your surgery. After receiving the information about your surgery, our team will get started right away to pre-authorize the treatment. Please give as much notice as possible as well as all medical notes. Most direct billing can be arranged within two weeks. As soon as we receive all documents required, direct billing can be arranged within 72 hours.
