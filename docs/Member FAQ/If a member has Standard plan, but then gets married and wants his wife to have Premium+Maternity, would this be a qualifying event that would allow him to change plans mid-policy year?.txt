If a member has Standard plan, but then gets married and wants his wife to have Premium+Maternity, would this be a qualifying event that would allow him to change plans mid-policy year? Plan upgrades or changes to your existing plan can only be made at renewal or within the first 15 days of your contract starting. A life-changing event like marriage or birth does qualify for your spouse or baby to be added to your plan throughout the policy year, but your plan will stay the same until your renewal.
