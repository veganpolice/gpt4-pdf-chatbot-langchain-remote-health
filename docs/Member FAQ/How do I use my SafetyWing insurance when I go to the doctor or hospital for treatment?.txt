How do I use my SafetyWing insurance when I go to the doctor or hospital for treatment? Pay upfront for most of your claims and file your claim in your SafetyWing member dashboard. You will need the following documents: a receipt that shows how much you paid and any medical notes that explain what the treatment was for, including diagnosis, treatment plan and prescriptions.Direct billing can be arranged for claims over $250 USD. However, if are struggling with payment for any amount, please reach out to the Remote Health team at rhnotify@safetywing.com.For emergency hospitalization or surgery, you can call our 24 emergency service at +1 855 276 8864, which will work with the hospital to handle billing directly.
