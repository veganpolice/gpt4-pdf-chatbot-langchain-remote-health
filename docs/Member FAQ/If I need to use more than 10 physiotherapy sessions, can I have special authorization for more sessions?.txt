Remote Health comes with two different benefits for physiotherapy.The rehabilitation and physio coverage under the outpatient benefit is covered at 100% of the UCR, up to the maximum of the overall benefit ($5,000). This treatment must be approved in advance. You'll need to fill out {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https: \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 this form}} and submit a treatment plan, estimated costs, and medical notes from your provider.The 10 sessions under complementary therapy can also be used for physiotherapy.
