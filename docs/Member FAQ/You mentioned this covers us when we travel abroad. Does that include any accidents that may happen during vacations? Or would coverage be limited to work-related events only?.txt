You mentioned this covers us when we travel abroad. Does that include any accidents that may happen during vacations? Or would coverage be limited to work-related events only? Yes, you are also covered while you travel! Travel can be for any reason, business or pleasure. The only exception is in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United States. In those three countries, coverage is limited to 30 days per trip, not to exceed 183 days or half of the year. The coverage is limited to emergency or non-elective coverage only.\There are a few countries where we cannot arrange direct billing for hospital stays. They are listed {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https: \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 here}}.
