Does this cover chronic meds? Yes, as long as your condition is covered in the policy and not a part of the exclusions. Prescription medications are covered under the outpatient benefit, which has a yearly maximum of $5,000 USD. If you claim any other outpatient benefits, they will also count towards the $5,000 limit.
