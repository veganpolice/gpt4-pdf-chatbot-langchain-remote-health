I'm located in Germany, and we are legally obliged to prove that we have health insurance. Do you know if Remote Health qualifies in this case? This depends on if you're a local German national or an expat.Remote Health can be bought as a top-up to the local plan if you're a local German national.Here are some reasons why members use Remote Health as top-up insurance:\-Faster treatment: reduced wait times to get the treatment you need by not joining public waiting lists.\-Freedom to choose the hospital you want: using a public health service can often restrict the hospitals you can visit. Remote Health gives you access to any public or private hospital.\-Eligible for cash payout: get paid up to $150 when staying in a free public hospital or when your treatment is covered by different insurance.\-Global coverage: use this coverage wherever you live, move, or work, so if you are a nomad or traveling, you don't need another insurance to cover your medical care.\-A referral from your general practitioner is not required before seeking care with a specialist. \\If you're an expat, you may buy this as a primary plan only after the local immigration office approves your visa.
