If I go to the hospital for an emergency and I stay all day, will this be considered an inpatient stay, or do I have to be admitted and stay overnight? An inpatient hospitalization means that you have been admitted to the hospital for a period of 24 hours or longer to receive medical or surgical care. Medical care limited to the emergency room or urgent care is not considered a hospitalization.
