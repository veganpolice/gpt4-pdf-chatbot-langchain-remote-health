Remote Health provides worldwide coverage. Does that include any accidents that may happen during vacations, or are we covered only while in our home country? Yes, you are also covered while you travel! Travel can be for any reason, business or pleasure. The only exceptions are Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United States. In those three countries, coverage is limited to 30 days per trip, not to exceed 183 days per year. The coverage is limited to emergency or non-elective coverage only.There are a few countries where we cannot arrange direct billing for hospital stays. They are listed {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https: \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 here}}.For all other countries, your full coverage will stay the same.
