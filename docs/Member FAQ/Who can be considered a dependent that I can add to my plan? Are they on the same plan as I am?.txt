Who can be considered a dependent that I can add to my plan? Are they on the same plan as I am? Eligible dependents include your spouse, domestic partner (only requirement is you reside in the same home), biological children, legally adopted children, step-children, or if a policyholder is a legal guardian of a minor. All dependents will be enrolled on the same plan as the policyholder. So, for example, If you are on Premium Plan, they will be enrolled in Premium too. Each family member will have their own policy, so that the maximum benefit limit applies to each member, not the entire family.
