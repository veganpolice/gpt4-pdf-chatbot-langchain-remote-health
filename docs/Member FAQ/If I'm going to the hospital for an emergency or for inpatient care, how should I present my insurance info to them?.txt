If I'm going to the hospital for an emergency or for inpatient care, how should I present my insurance info to them? We recommend printing your insurance card and keeping it on you. Your card will be loaded into your online member dashboard. Otherwise, you can pay for treatment, collect the medical notes and invoice and submit a claim on your online member dashboard.If you need to go to the hospital for a pre-planned treatment, you can notify us in advance.
