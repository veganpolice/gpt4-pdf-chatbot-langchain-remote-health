What does a 5K outpatient limit mean? A maximum limit is the maximum amount of money that Remote Health will cover for eligible claims during the policy year ($5,000 for all outpatient benefits). This amount restarts on the renewal date of your policy. For example: if your Remote Health policy ends on July 1, 2022, your benefits will renew on August 30, 2023. In other words, when the policy renews, your benefit maximums are reset.
