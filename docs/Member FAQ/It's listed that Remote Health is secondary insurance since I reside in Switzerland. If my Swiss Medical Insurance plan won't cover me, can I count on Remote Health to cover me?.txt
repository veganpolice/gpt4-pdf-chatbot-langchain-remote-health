It's listed that Remote Health is secondary insurance since I reside in Switzerland. If my Swiss Medical Insurance plan won't cover me, can I count on Remote Health to cover me? Yes, if Remote Health is considered secondary insurance in your country, the primary insurance would cover first, and Remote Health would work as a top-up. For any dispute, the insurance company will attempt to solve this with the other insurance company without requiring anything from the member.
