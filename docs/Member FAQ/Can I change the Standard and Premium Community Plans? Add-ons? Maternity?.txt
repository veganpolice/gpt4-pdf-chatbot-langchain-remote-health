Can I change the Standard and Premium Community Plans? Add-ons? Maternity? When we built our Community Plans, we analyzed what our members want and need the most. As a result, we created the best plan we could imagine for an incredible cost. The plans are fixed and do not allow custom add-ons. If you are looking for the most coverage possible, we suggest the Premium Plus Maternity Plan. The only add-on available for any plan is the add-on for coverage in Hong Kong or Singapore.
