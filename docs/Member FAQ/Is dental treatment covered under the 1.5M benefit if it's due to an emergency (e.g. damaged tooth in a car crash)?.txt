Is dental treatment covered under the 1.5M benefit if it's due to an emergency (e.g. damaged tooth in a car crash)? Yes, it would! Reconstructive surgery, emergency dental treatment and rehabilitation to restore natural function to the limbs and face would be covered under our maximum benefit limit (so that, for instance, you can continue to eat, drink, walk and talk properly following a serious accident). See {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https: \cf4 \ul \ulc4 \strokec4 this page}} of the policy document for more info.
