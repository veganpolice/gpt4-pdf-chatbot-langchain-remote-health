What are the extra benefits if an employee already has public healthcare in their country of residence? In countries with public systems (for example, the UK and Norway), SafetyWing has an added advantage: it can be used in addition to a country-specific plan. SafetyWing's added benefits include visiting any private hospital for the best and quickest service. If your public healthcare system covers your hospital treatment, you receive a $150 cash bonus per night in a public hospital in your home country (up to 30 nights). You can get access to treatments typically not provided by standard public healthcare, for example, the latest available cancer treatment regimens. Use this coverage wherever you live, move, or work, so you don't need other insurance to cover your health if you are a nomad or traveling.
