Do you do a health checkup prior to the start of the insurance? Do you exclude pre-existing conditions? No health checkups are required! We do not exclude pre-existing conditions as long as they are not listed as a general exclusion. So, for example, if you have a pre-existing case of TMJ, it would not be covered only because it is excluded in the overall policy.
